Through the framework of five codes—namely, anti-self-objectification, anti-self-limitation, anti-self-loathing, breaking stereotypes, and celebrating sisterhood—derived from literature review, this study utilizes natural language processing techniques to conduct quantitative analyses of the most common words, stylistic choices, and sentiment, summarizing the linguistic characteristics and patterns of each code’s lyrics. This approach offers insights into lyrics writing that express anti-internalized sexism ideologies.
