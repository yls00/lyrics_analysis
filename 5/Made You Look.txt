I could have my Gucci on
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothing on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)
I'll make you double take soon as I walk away
Call up your chiropractor just in case your neck break
Ooh, tell me what you, what you, what you gon' do? Ooh
'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene, double up that sunscreen
I'm 'bout to turn the heat up, gonna make your glasses steam
Ooh, tell me what you, what you, what you gon' do? Ooh
When I do my walk, walk
I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got
Ladies, if you feel me, this your bop, bop
(Bop, bop, bop)
I could have my Gucci on (Gucci on)
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothing on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)
Yeah, I look good in my Versace dress (take it off)
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess
But even with my hoodie on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)
(Hmm-hmm-hmm)
And once you get a taste, you'll never be the same
This ain't that ordinary, it's that 14 karat cake
Ooh, tell me what you, what you
What you gon' do? Ooh
When I do my walk, walk
I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got
Ladies, if you feel me, this your bop, bop
(Bop, bop, bop)
I could have my Gucci on (Gucci on)
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothing on
Bet I made you look (said I made you look)
Yeah, I look good in my Versace dress (take it off)
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess
But even with my hoodie on
Bet I made you look (said, I made you look)
